# The SPARK Language

SPARK is a progmramming language formally analyzable subset of Ada language. The primary goal of the SPARK is to provide a foundation for a sound formal verification fre 
spark is safe and robust languages because pretty much every operation is synchranized either statically or by means of a runtime check what gannett proof can formally verify is that no runtime check can raise constraint error that no assertion can fail and raise assertion error and that no user exception could possibly be raised if
