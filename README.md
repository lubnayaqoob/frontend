# The SPARK Language

SPARK is a progmramming language formally analyzable subset of Ada language. The primary goal of the SPARK is to provide a foundation for a sound formal verification of software.  

## Use of Spark in Autonomous Truck Platooning

Because of syncronization of every opertion (either statically or run time check) SPARK verify that no run time check can rais constraint error and no assertion can fail and raise assertion error and that no user exception could possibly be raised.
Test cases written for follow_path verify the precondition checck  and postcondition check
